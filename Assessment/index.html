      Using semantic tags like <b>'strong'</b> over presentational tags like
      <b>'b'</b> is crucial for accessibility and SEO. Semantic tags convey
      meaning to both users and search engines, helping to accurately interpret
      the content's significance and structure. Additionally, semantic tags
      provide better accessibility for screen readers and other assistive
      technologies, ensuring that the content is properly understood and
      navigable by all users, including those with disabilities. Overall,
      adhering to semantic HTML practices improves both the usability and search
      engine ranking of a webpage while promoting inclusivity and accessibility.

      The choice between ordered and unordered lists significantly impacts the
      visual presentation and user experience of a webpage. Ordered lists (ol)
      typically present information in a numbered sequence, indicating a
      specific order or hierarchy to the listed items. This format is
      particularly useful for conveying step-by-step instructions, rankings, or
      any other content where the order is important. Users can easily follow
      the numbered sequence, which provides a clear structure and aids
      comprehension. In terms of visual presentation, ordered lists often
      feature numbered bullets, which visually guide the user through the list
      and emphasize the sequential nature of the content.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, unordered lists (ul) present information in a bulleted
      or unnumbered format, without implying any particular order or hierarchy
      among the listed items. Unordered lists are ideal for presenting sets of
      items where the order is not significant, such as lists of features,
      benefits, or related topics. Visually, unordered lists often feature
      bullet points, which help to separate individual items and make the list
      easier to scan and digest. This format provides a more flexible and
      relaxed structure compared to ordered lists, allowing users to focus on
      the content without being constrained by a predetermined sequence.
      Overall, the choice between ordered and unordered lists should align with
      the content's logical structure and the user's needs to optimize visual
      presentation and enhance the user experience of the webpage.

    <h1>HTML Table Structure</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            table: Acts as the container for the entire table, enclosing all rows and columns within it.
        </li>
        <li>
            tr: Represents a table row, containing one or more table cells (th or td).
        </li>
        <li>
            th: Denotes a table header cell, typically used to define column or row headings.
        </li>
        <li>
            td: Represents a table data cell, used to contain the actual data values within the table.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
  </body>By utilizing these elements in combination, developers can organize tabular data effectively within HTML documents. Each <tr> element encapsulates a row of cells, with <th> elements typically used for headers and <td> elements for data cells. The <table> element provides the overall structure for the table, allowing for the creation of structured and accessible tables for displaying various types of data.
